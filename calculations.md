## Mini Solar PV for Refrigerator - 2, 100W Panels

Power in = 200W 

I = 200/12 = 16.7 A 

Assuming you could make the converter 100% efficient the power out will be 

120 x I(out) = power in = 200W 

Calculating this current gives 200/120 = 1.67 A 

This is for 100% conversion of the power.

Generally you should work on an 80% figure (there is always power loss) so the output power will be 160W 
(80% of 200W) and this give an output current of 160/120 = 1.33 amps.

= 159.6 W (Produced by system)

Modern (500kWh/year) fridge power consumption running 9hr/day

= 1370Wh/day (Question to ask is how much W can the battery hold at full charge? The ideal is to not deplete the battery past 50%)

= 1370Wh/9h 

= 152 W (Consumed by load)
