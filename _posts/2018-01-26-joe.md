Watch this body doing what it feels it must.

Even drones know to jostle for airspace but,  
I told him, it’s never too late to call your daughters.

This grind has ground the love out of you, but  
Neither of us is ever far from the things we can’t see.

At dusk, the clouds make a gradient above the Waianae range  
And, I think then that I’m at the place I’ve never been.

Joe (I should have said), there’s only really  
one way to learn about the internet—  

You must become a constellation.
