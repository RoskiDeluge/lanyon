title: Media Are My Friends
---

In the beginning was the word,  
but for millenia  
the token traded  
was simply  
void.

Back in San Jo, we'd get embroiled in some 
innocuous altercation, have a smoke and think  
(words are the nexus between sight and feeling).

The threshold is the message; 
the path through the shifting signifiers. 

Stars mean this train only stops at black market depots. 

This chain holds the foundation for our I's mythos. 

Thin myself through scattered pieces in that ledger. 

Mi preciosa, I'm there in my friends, 
and in these letters.
