(For Nicanor Parra)

Here’s a space for it...  

Something close to freedom,

In synch with whatever is speaking through me.

It may be the anti —  
Even tú también.

It may be what’s left undone from yesterday or today.

There’s no reason to feel like an impostor,  
Especially when we’re talking about eternity.  

For time dissolves all pretense  

and while its ceremony is a white light,  

Its memory is my whole being.
