title: A Boss Named Bob
---

Cheap thrill blazed this sacrosanct trail we walked on,
Yet you never knew the rage.

To see that words are dissolving in their referents,
A whole life's toil,
A smile from our haole boss. 

But, really, the crux of our year long impasse

came to this

You failed three times to make varsity
and I was a letterman. 

We dissappear in this question

What is the universe doing?
