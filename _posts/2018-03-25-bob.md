title: A Boss Named Bob
---

Cheap thrill blazed this sacrosanct trail we walked on,  
yet you never knew the rage.

To see that words are dissolving in their referents,  
a whole life's toil,  
a smile from our haole boss. 

But, really, the crux of our year long impasse

came to this

you failed three times to make varsity  
and I was a letterman. 

We dissappear in this question

what is the universe doing?
